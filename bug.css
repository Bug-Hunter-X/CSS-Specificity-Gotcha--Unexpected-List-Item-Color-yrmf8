The following CSS code snippet intends to style a list item, but it suffers from specificity issues:

```css
li {
  color: blue;
}

.special-list li {
  color: red;
}

.another-class li {
    color: green;
}

<ul class="special-list another-class">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

The unexpected behavior is that the list items remain blue, instead of red or green as might be expected given the more specific selectors. This is because the class selectors `.special-list` and `.another-class` have equal specificity to the `li` selector, but the `li` selector is declared earlier and thus takes precedence.  While not strictly an *error* in the sense of a syntax mistake, it's a common misunderstanding of CSS specificity.
